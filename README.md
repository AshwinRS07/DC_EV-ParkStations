# DC_EV-ParkStations
A visualization and classification task to check for inefficiencies in EV charging station allocation based on proximity to available parking stations.
This was included as part of the Urban Computing Coursework during Masters.
The primary objective of our project is to find out if there are enough number of vehicle charging/fuel station and vehicle parking spaces, along with average
amount of time it takes to find and park a vehicle, in a given residential neighborhood, while keeping in mind the avg number of cars that household in that
area owns. Doing so, would help us analyze, are their less or surplus of charging stations or parking spaces in a neighborhood, as surplus/extra means waste of city
resources, and thus in turn help in either redistribution of resources or help plan better for the future.
Data:
We have 3 different datasets available with us, one for Parking Statistics in North
America, one for location of different types of fuel stations across united states
and one for vehicle ownership in U.S. cities.
